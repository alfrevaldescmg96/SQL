FROM
        CITY
WHERE
        POPULATION >= 100000
        AND COUNTRYCODE = 'USA';

-- #2 Query the NAME field for all American cities in the CITY table with populations larger than 120000. The CountryCode for America is USA.

 --#3 Query all columns (attributes) for every row in the CITY table.

--#4 Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, 
  as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). 
  If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.

(SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY) 
FROM STATION 
ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY) ASC, CITY ASC 
LIMIT 1)

UNION ALL

(SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY) 
FROM STATION 
ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY) DESC, CITY ASC 
LIMIT 1);

--#5 Query the list of CITY names from STATION which have vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, and u) as both their first and last characters. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

SELECT 
    DISTINCT CITY 
FROM 
    STATION 
WHERE 
    LEFT(CITY, 1 ) IN ('A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U')
    AND RIGHT(CITY, 1 ) IN ('A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U');

--#6 Query the Name of any student in STUDENTS who scored higher than  Marks. Order your output by the last three characters of each name. 
 -- If two or more students both have names ending in the same last three characters (i.e.: Bobby, Robby, etc.), secondary sort them by ascending ID.
SELECT
        Name
FROM
        STUDENTS 
WHERE
        Marks > 75
ORDER BY 
        RIGHT(NAME,3),
        ID;
